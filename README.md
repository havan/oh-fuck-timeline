# The Slerf Saga

The Slerf Saga unfolded dramatically over the course of a few days in March 2024, capturing the cryptocurrency community's attention with a series of events that could rival any fictional thriller. It started with the creation of a presale for a new digital token, $SLERF, by @slerfsol, which quickly raised $10 million, showcasing the high interest and speculative fervor within the crypto space. The presale success led to the creation of the token and the launch of a website, setting the stage for what many hoped would be the next big thing in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

However, the narrative took a sharp turn when, in an attempt to burn unwanted tokens, the creator accidentally destroyed 500 million $SLERF tokens, a move that drastically reduced the available supply and inadvertently increased the token's value due to the sudden scarcity. This incident was announced through an infamous "oh fuck" tweet, which was followed by a flurry of explanations and apologies from @slerfsol. Despite this mistake, the community rallied around the project, discussing ways to help and mitigate the damage done to presale investors.

In the aftermath of the accidental burn, $SLERF's price began to surge as the market reacted to the reduced supply. This turn of events led to major exchanges announcing plans to list the $SLERF token, further fueling its unexpected rise. As the saga continued, @slerfsol engaged with the community through Twitter Spaces, attempting to navigate the project through its tumultuous start. Despite the setbacks, the token achieved a significant trading volume, with various cryptocurrency platforms and influencers rallying to support the project through donations and public endorsements.

The Slerf Saga is emblematic of the volatile and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, where fortunes can be made and lost overnight, and community support can play a critical role in a project's survival. It highlights the technical risks associated with digital asset management, the importance of transparency and communication in crisis situations, and the unyielding enthusiasm of the crypto community to support innovative, albeit risky, ventures.

The series of events surrounding the Slerf Saga, from its explosive start to the community's response to setbacks, underscores the speculative dynamics of the crypto market and the collective efforts to navigate its uncertainties. It remains a cautionary tale about the importance of diligence and the potential for recovery through community support in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.

### Token Distribution

@slerfsol decided, for security reasons, to send presale $SLERF tokens in batches to the dev who will distribute them to the presales. While trying to do this, he had issues and decided first to burn the shit tokens people have sent to him. He used https://solanatools.vercel.app/ and https://sol-incinerator.com/ to do that.

# oh fuck

While incinerating the shit tokens in his wallet, he accidentally included the 500 million $SLERF tokens and burned them all, without realizing what he did. 

Someone messaged him why he burned all his tokens and he said I didn’t. Then checked the chain and realized what he did. And tweeted the infamous “oh fuck” tweet:

Topics were; what can be done to repair the damage done to the presalers, what should @slerfsol do legally. Reaching out to the exchanges and creating a donation wallet were talked in this first spaces. As far as I know these first spaces were not recorded as recommended by some attendants. 

### $SLERF starts its journey
